# ONE OK ROCK – So Far Gone

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
BROKEN
WHEN I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE WHOLE
ALL THE FUTURE MEMORIES
THAT WE'LL NEVER GET TO KNOW
EXPLAINING EXPLAINING
THE PAIN THAT I GOT
WHEN YOU LEFT ME IN THIS LIFE
TELL ME I CAN DO THIS
I CAN DO THIS ON MY OWN
WE'RE VICTIMS OF LOVE
ONE AFTER ONE
STUCK ON THE DARK SIDE OF THE SUN
BATTLES WE LOST
BATTLES WE WON
I KNOW
SO FAR GONE
THE WEIGHT OF YOUR NAME
GONNA KEEP ME STEADY
I'LL BE STRONG TONIGHT
YOU'RE NEVER SO FAR GONE
PIECES OF YOU SHINING THROUGH THE CLOUDS
YOU LIVE ON TONIGHT
SLOWLY
FOUND THE ROAD TO GUIDE ME HOME
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT HERE
I KNOW WE ARE NOT ALONE
EXPLAINING EXPLAINING
THE PAIN THAT I GOT
WHEN YOU LEFT ME IN THIS LIFE
YEAH IT'S HARD SOMETIMES
YOU'RE NEVER SO FAR GONE
THE WEIGHT OF YOUR NAME
GONNA KEEP ME STEADY
I'LL BE STRONG TONIGHT
YOU'RE NEVER SO FAR GONE
PIECES OF YOU
SHINING THROUGH THE CLOUDS
YOU LIVE ON TONIGHT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT LIFE IS WITHOUT YOU
STILL I FEEL YOU WITH ME EVERY MOVE
SO CLOSE, YET SO FAR
LIKE THE MOON AND THE STARS
YOU'RE NEVER SO FAR GONE
THE WEIGHT OF YOUR NAME
GONNA KEEP ME STEADY
I'LL BE STRONG TONIGHT
YOU'RE NEVER SO FAR GONE
PIECES OF YOU
SHINING THROUGH THE CLOUDS
YOU LIVE ON TONIGHT
NANANA...
SO FAR GONE
THE WEIGHT OF YOUR NAME
GONNA KEEP ME STEADY
I'LL BE STRONG TONIGHT
