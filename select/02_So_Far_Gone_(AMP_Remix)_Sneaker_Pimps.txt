The sun ate the moon
Swallowed the weather
Busy old fool
Now the days last forever

The center won't hold
Exempt of the rules
To burn through the night
To sound the retreat
It fractures the whole
A brutal excuse
Frantic like a child
From panic to attack

So far gone
Never reformed
Fall so hard
Into the storm

The sun ate the moon
Swallowed the weather

A summer of love
Cooled to an autumn
Tumble and fall
Striking out for heaven

So far gone
Never reformed
Fall so hard
Into the storm

The sun ate the moon
Swallowed the weather
A beautiful gesture
A beautiful future

So far gone
Never reformed
Fall so hard
Into the storm

The sun ate the moon
Swallowed the weather
The sun ate the moon
Swallowed the weather
